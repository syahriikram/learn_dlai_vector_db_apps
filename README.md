# Introduction
Deeplearning.ai course on building vector database applications. Vector Databases let's you input a collection of vectors, and that powers the 6 amazing applications we learn in the course.

## Semantic Search
Using Sentence Transformers (a.k.a. SBERT) to compute embeddings. This unlocks a wide range of applications, including semantic search semantic textual similarity, and paraphrase mining. In Lesson 1, we did a Semantic Search.
1. Using a Quora question bank dataset we stored the indexes in  `pinecone` which is our Vector Database (Serverless).
2. Query a sentence to the DB.
3. Get top X response from the DB.

## Retrieval Augmented Generation
